<!-- HTML SYNTAX -->

<!-- 
    HTML is made up of elements . 
 
    An Element has an opening tag, a closing tag and text content or inner html(other elements) in between.

    <openingtag> content </closingtag>

    NOTE: Some elements are self-closing e.g. meta tags, img, br e.t.c

    The html element is refered to as the ROOT element(it is a parent to all elements in the page)
    
    Within the html element , we have the head element and the body element as immediate children.

    The head element acts like a container for metadata about your webpage. This information is not directly displayed on the page but is crucial for browsers and search engines. We also link to external files within the head element e.g css and js


    The body element encloses the visible content of your webpage, everything users see and interact with.

    Some elements have compulsory attributes while in others attributes are optional.
    Attributes provide more info about an element or even add functionality to the element. Examples of attributes include lang(language), src(source), id(uniquely identifying the element) e.t.c
